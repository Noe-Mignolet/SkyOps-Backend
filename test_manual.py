"""
Manual test file for sending inputs to the server with manual point selection.
Inputs:
  - Buildings.png file (buildings image)
  - Satelite.png file (satellite image)
  - The user manually selects 2 points from the satellite image:
       The first point is used as top_left_coord (takeoff, marked in green)
       The second point is used as bottom_right_coord (landing, marked in red)
       
After selecting the points, the Buildings image is updated by setting the corresponding pixels 
(with a single pixel mark) and saved as "Buildings_marked.png". The updated image is then shown 
for approval. After pressing any key, the images and coordinate strings are sent to the server 
(POST URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/create-mission).
